Design Philosophy
--
We ultimately need access to all of Vulkans functionality. To begin with, aim to
get wrapper classes for all of the Vulkan objects that are represented by
handles into vk.h. This step can be verified by comparing to the handle 
definitions in the Vulkan specification XML file.

Not all objects have creation/destruction functions. For example, queues are 
tightly bound to logical device construction. Where objects do have 
creation/destruction functions, the default design pattern should be to indirect
implementions through a shared pointer.
